## Purpose of Project
The purpose of this project was to use Django to create an app. I have the basic command from the Django tutorial and changed
the look and needs to fit my purpose. I wanted to create a Dog of the Month application to create a polling system.

You will see some of my files will not execute properly.
I haven't found where I can fix my issue but, I will list my attempts for the project here.
- Creating a selection button for the dog candidate by selecting to pictures using the radio button. I hae set up the button in the polls/questions.html file.
- Creating a database to have the image populate with the name of the dog. I do not know how to create the array with the database. Created in the index.html file.
- Have a live results percentage on the results page in the same layout as the polls. Wanted to create in the results file.
